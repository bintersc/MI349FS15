Hello Professor, 

This is Scott Binter

By way of some explanation for my project, here are all the RELEVANT files that are on my website, i.e. all the things I wrote
that were not taken care of automatically by the backend hosting site I use that largely provides JSON functionality 
and a myriad of other necessary functions. I'm sure you get the idea.

I have 4 'HTML' pages that are really PHP as some of the HTML needed to be modular.

Inside the php folder you will find my header and footer that provide the framework in most of the site.

Feel free when visiting the homepage to make an account. If you would like to log out to test functionality, unfortunately
I do not have that implemented. That being said, the session (and your login) only lasts as long as your browser is open.
I would have liked to add a logout to the system, but was running out of time towards the end.

The spell search page is likely the most simplistic part of the project, by which I mean that it is NOT remotely complete.
I could not get the search algorithm I was looking into developing working for my SQL backend. Thus, it only responds
to SPECIFIC (and correct) queries. For testing purposes, I included a spell 'Magic Missile' that you can use to understand
where that page was generally going. In the end, due to my struggles with the algorithm and my lack of hours and hours to 
type in various spells I have provided that example alone for now while the rest is under development.

I was one of the students who wished to pursue an honors option. For that option I have implemented relatively secure user 
accounts myself, hashing and salting the account passwords within an SQL database. I am also doing storage for the characters
and the vast majority of my data in pushes and pulls from that database.

Obviously if you have any questions, feel free to let me know. My email is bintersc@msu.edu, phone (630) 335-2274.

Thanks!
